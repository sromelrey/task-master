- [ ] Wrap those handlers in `useCallback` in the parent component (e.g., `TaskBoard` or page component)
- [ ] Apply `React.memo` to presentational components like `TaskCard` and possibly `TaskColumn`

- [ ] (Optional) Use React DevTools Profiler to compare render counts before vs after optimization
- [ ] Document how and why `useCallback` and `React.memo` were applied in this project
- [ ] Commit performance optimization changes

## Component Notes – React Optimizations

### `TaskBoard`

- **Role:** Top-level board that orchestrates columns, drag-and-drop logic, and filtering.
- **Optimizations:**

  - **`useMemo`**

    - Used to compute derived data such as `filteredTasks` or grouped tasks per column (e.g., `tasksByStatus`), based on raw task list + filters.
    - Prevents re-running filter/sort logic on every render when inputs haven’t changed.

  - **`useCallback`**

    - Used for handlers like `handleAddTask`, `handleUpdateTask`, `handleDeleteTask`, and `handleDragEnd` that are passed down to child components.
    - Keeps function references stable, which works well with `React.memo` in children.

  - Passes memoized data and callbacks down to `TaskColumn` and `TaskCard` to minimize unnecessary re-renders.

---

### `TaskColumn`

- **Role:** Represents a single column in the board (e.g., Todo, In Progress, Done) and renders a list of `TaskCard` components.
- **Optimizations:**

  - **`React.memo`**

    - Wraps `TaskColumn` in `React.memo` so it only re-renders when its props (e.g., column title, list of tasks, column-specific handlers) change.
    - Especially useful when there are multiple columns; changing one column’s tasks shouldn’t re-render all others unnecessarily.

  - Receives memoized task arrays (from `TaskBoard`’s `useMemo`) and functions (from `useCallback`) to keep prop references stable.

---

### `TaskCard`

- **Role:** Displays a single task’s information and handles interactions (e.g., edit, delete, drag handle).
- **Optimizations:**

  - **`React.memo`**

    - Ensures that a `TaskCard` re-renders only when its specific `task` prop or callbacks change.
    - Important when there are many cards; updating one task shouldn’t cause all cards to re-render.

  - Benefits directly from:

    - Stable `task` objects (if derived via `useMemo` at a higher level).
    - Stable callback references from `useCallback` in the parent.

---

### `TaskFilters`

- **Role:** UI for selecting filters such as status, priority, or date-based views.
- **Optimizations:**

  - **`useCallback`**

    - Used for onChange handlers that update filter state (e.g., `handleStatusChange`, `handlePriorityChange`).
    - Prevents new handler functions from being created on every render, which helps when `TaskFilters` is memoized or when handlers are passed further down.

  - **`React.memo`** (optional)

    - Can be wrapped in `React.memo` if it receives stable props and should only re-render when filter options or current filter values change.

---

### Root Page / App Entry (`app/page.tsx` or equivalent)

- **Role:** Coordinates providers (Redux, theme), renders `TaskBoard`, and wires high-level app logic.
- **Optimizations:**

  - Light use of hooks here; most logic should live in `TaskBoard` and lower components.
  - Might use `useEffect` for side effects such as initial hydration from `localStorage` or global app-level behaviors.
  - Delegates actual performance-critical logic down into the board and task components to keep the entry component simple.
